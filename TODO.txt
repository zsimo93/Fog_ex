- model for constraints and predication

- setup component (SSH)
- select new Backup and start it

- When backup take place of master:
    change ip, 
    invoke mainDB.removeNodeReplicaSet with its old value in db
    update old ip and role in DB

    choose new Backup and start components...

- Algorithm to choose function deployment - dumb to all
- Algorithm to choose function placement

- core.API.validator    # TODO add other constraints

- core.API.nodes    #TODO run setup

- disable api, not internal, if node not a master
